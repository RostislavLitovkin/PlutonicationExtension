This is a [polkadot.js extension](https://github.com/polkadot-js/extension) compatible browser extension for [Plutonication](https://github.com/cisar2218/Plutonication).

It can connect to any web dApp supporting `polkadot.js extension` and it will generate a QR code for you to scan.
Once the QR code is scanned, the wallet will connect to the dApp and it will be ready to receive transaction requests.
Everything by that point is automatic.
